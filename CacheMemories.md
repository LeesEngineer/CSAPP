# Cache Memories

</br>

<p>Cache memories are fast SRAM-based memories managed automatically in hardware, and hold frequently accessed blocks of main memory.</p>

<p>Most of our requests for data will actually be served out of this cache memory and cost a few cycles rather than the slow main memory.</p>

<p>Hardware logic has to know how to look for blocks in cache, and determine whether or not a perticular block is contained here. So cache memory has to be organized in a strict way.</p>
