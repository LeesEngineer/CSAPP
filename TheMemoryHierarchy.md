<p>The memory system is a very complex hierarchy of devices that provides the abstraction of this large linear array.</p>

# Storage Technologies

</br>

<p>Now the workhorse memory is called Random-Access Memory(RAM). RAM comes in two varieties: SRAM(Static RAM) and DRAM(Dynamic RAM). They are distinguished by the way that those cells are implemented.</p>

- RAM is traditionally packaged as a chip

- Basic storage unit is normally a cell (one bit per cell)

- Multiple RAM chips form a memory
