# Linking

</br>

```
// sum.c
int sum(int *a, int n)
{
    int i, s = 0;

    for(i = 0; i < n; i ++)
        s += a[i];
    return s;
}
```

```
// main.c
int sum(int *a, int n);

int array[2] = {1, 2};

int main()
{
    int val = sum(array, 2);
    return val;
}
```

<p>That's kind of an odd thing to return your exit status like that, we just did it so that the compiler wouldn't optimize away all of the code. Because compiler must ensure that the return val is computed correctly</p>

# Library interpositioning

</br>

<p>This technique allows you to use linking to actually intercept on function calls in libraries like the standard C library. It's all enabled by linking.</p>
