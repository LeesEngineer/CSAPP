# Great Reality #1: Ints are not Intergers, Floats are not reals

</br>

<p>Example one: Is x^2 >= 0?</p>

- float's: Yes

- Int's: 40000*40000 & 50000*50000 -> ? has the potential for overflow

<p>Example two: Is (x+y)+z == x+(y+z)?</p>

- Ungigned & Signed int's: Yes

- Float's:
  1. (1e20 + -1e20) + 3.14 -> 3.14
 
  2. 1e20 + (-1e20 + 3.14) -> 0

<p>Because the range of values you can get in floating pointers so extreme that some numbers kind of disappear. So taht 3.14 compared to -1e20 is so insignificant, that result gets turned into -1e20</p>

<p>you sort of drop the digits that aren't significant</p>

<p>So it's not associative</p>

<p>The both these number systems have some peculiarities, And it all comes down to the fact that they use finite representations of things that are potentially infinite in their expanse</p>

# Great Reality #2: You've Got to Konw Assembly

</br>

<p>Chances are, you will never write programs in assembly. But, Understanding assembly is key to machine-level execution model</p>

- Behavior of programs in presence of bugs

- Tuning program performance

- Implementing system software

- Creating/fighting malware(x86 assembly is the language of choice )

</br>

# Great Reality #3: Memory Matter

</br>

- Memory is not unbounded

  1. It must be allocated and managed
 
  2. Many application are memory dominated
 
- Memory referenceing bugs espacially pernicious

- Memory performance is not uniform

  1. Cache and virtual memory effects can greatly affect program performance
 
  2. Adapting program to characteristics of memory system can lead to major speed improvements
 
<b>Memory Referencing Bug Example</b>

```
typedef struct
{
    int a[2];
    double d;
} struct_t;

double fun(int i)
{
    volatile struct_t s;
    s.d = 3.14;
    s.a[i] = 1073741824;
    return s.d;
}
```

```
fun(0) -> 3.14
fun(1) -> 3.14
fun(2) -> 3.1399998664856
fun(3) -> 2.00000061035156
fun(4) -> 3.14
fun(6) -> Segmentation Fault
```

<p>The reason has to do with how data is laid out in memory and how its accessed, and one of the features of C and C++. It doesn't do any bounds checking on a race. It will happily let you reference, instead of complaining. But the operating system might complain as access out of range occurred here</p>

<p>The two elements of a each are four bytes, D is eight bytes and there's some other stuff in the other beyond them, that's not actually in the structured zone</p>

<p>When I'm calling fun(2) or fun(3), what I'm actually doing is altering the bytes that encode this number 'd'</p>

<p>When I hit 6, I'm modifying some state of the program that it's using to kind of keep things organized, most likely how it keeps track of allocated memory. And that's causing the program to crash</p>

<p>C and C++ do not provide any memory protection</p>

<p>It's also often the case that you'll cause some problem and it has a sort of action a distance feature. Thing might run fine for hours days or weeks, so figuring out memory referencing errors can be some of the worst debugging nightmare</p>

# Great Reality #4: There is more to performance than asymptotic complexity

</br>

- Constant factors matter too

- And even exact op count doesn't predict performance

- Must understand system to optimize performance

```
void copyij(int src[2048][2048], int dest[2048][2048])
{
		int i, j;
		for(i = 0; i < 2048; i ++)
				for(j = 0; j < 2048; j ++)
						dest[i][j] = src[i][j];
}
void copyji(int src[2048][2048], int dest[2048][2048])
{
		int i, j;
		for(j = 0; j < 2048; j ++)
				for(i = 0; i < 2048; i ++)
						dest[i][j] = src[i][j];
}
```

<p>These two functions do exactly the same thing in terms of their behavior</p>

<p>The first is much faster than the other, In this particular machine we ran this two programs on it was about close to 20 times difference in performance. The one that that goes through a row by row is much better than the one that goes through column by colimn. And it has to do with this memory hierarchy and what they call the cache memories</p>

# Great Reality #5: Computers do more than execute programs

</br>

- They need to get data in and out

- They communicate with each other over networks
